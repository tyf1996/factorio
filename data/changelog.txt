---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 23. 11. 2020
  Major Features:
    - Added logistic requests to spidertron.
    - Train stop allows to set limit of incoming trains.
  Features:
    - The continue button now respects the last type of game played (single player, MP host, MP client).
    - Added support to use blueprints, deconstruction planners, upgrade planners, and modded selection tools from the map view.
    - Hovering the alert notification will show arrows on the edge of the pointing to alert locations.
    - Rich text icon selector.
    - Newly unlocked recipes are highlighted until hovered.
    - Spidertron remotes now allow to add queue commands and a command to follow any entity.
    - Added vertical/horizontal blueprint flipping.
    - Transport belt drag building is locked into a line, can be turned off by an interface setting.
    - Ghosts can be fast replaced and rotated.
    - Ghost build can be used to fast replace non-ghost entities, which results in an upgrade order with (optionally) a direction
      change order.
  Minor Features:
    - When editing blueprint:
      Added a way to specify relative grid position for blueprint that is snapping to absolute grid.
      Blueprint preview rendering box is updated based on selected grid size and position.
    - Inventory transfer works on empty equipment grid slot the same as on empty inventory slot (moves all).
    - Equipment can be placed by moving.
    - Cursor replenishes when placing into the equipment grid the same way as when building in world.
    - Spidertron item shows its color.
    - Added a way to reset spidertron remote.
    - Spider tries to move legs away when they are blocking robots construction.
    - Power poles/underground belts built by dragging logic works also with ghost building.
    - Power pole ghosts show connections.
    - Power pole connections are saved in the blueprint. They still auto connect to other poles outside the blueprint.
    - Entities marked for deconstruction show the target upgrade.
    - Added tags, worker robots, rail signal states and recipes toggles into the settings to what show on the map.
    - Added support to use the add-stop and add-temporary-stop controls for the train you're driving in the map view.
    - Added hotkey (F10) to switch between viewed player in replay.
    - Added support to reset mod settings in the "failed to load mods" startup GUI.
    - Expanded undo to work with fast replace and upgrade planner.
    - Added SteelSeries GameSense support. (https://steelseries.com/engine/apps)
  Graphics:
    - Added unique technology icon for Advanced material processing 2 (Electric furnace).
    - Changed postprocessing effect in zoomed-to-world view.
    - Added detailed night lighting of entities.
  Optimizations:
    - Multithreaded belt update logic.
    - Overall small entity update time reduction + statistics of how much update time is taken by individual entities.
  Balancing:
    - Productivity module 1 decreases speed of the machine by 5% instead of 15%.
    - Productivity module 2 decreases speed of the machine by 10% instead of 15%.
  Changes:
    - the Close GUI key-binding (default value is "E") was renamed to Confirm Gui.
      It works the same as before for many cases (just closing the GUI), but in a lot of other cases, it works as confirm, which generally means
      the same as clicking the "green button".
    - Renamed clean-cursor to clear-cursor on all the relevant places (locale, key-binding name)
    - Equipment placing now uses the build key-binding instead of the cursor transfer. The default same key-binding is the same.
    - Changed maximum temperature of all fluids apart water and steam to be the same as the default.
    - Poles built by dragging are now actually build on the maximum connection distance from the last built pole instead of the
      previous logic that was working weird in a lot of corner cases.

Version: 0.18.37
Date: 29. 07. 2020
  Major Features:
    - New blueprint library GUI. Its user interface had been aligned with the way inventory works in as many ways as possible. (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-356)
  Features:
    - Added blueprint building from the map view.
    - Blueprints can have snapping dimensions specified. When they are built by dragging, they are only built in the grid relative to where the build started.
    - Blueprints can have absolute map snapping specified, so the blueprints are always aligned to the global grid.
    - Blueprint books can be inserted into blueprint books, cycling through the books works in a hierarchical way.
    - Upgrade planners and deconstruction planners can be inserted into blueprint books and the blueprint library.
    - Blueprint books, upgrade planners and deconstruction planners can now have custom icons specified.
    - All blueprints tools have an editable description.
    - Added Blueprint reassign tool. It allows to set new contents of a blueprint by world selection.
    - All blueprint tools have a copy function.
    - All the blueprint tools are usable directly from the blueprint library.
    - Quickbar links to blueprint tools are persistent when moving them between library shelves and inventories.
    - Most of the blueprint tools manipulation in the blueprint library is part of a multiplayer latency hiding.
    - Icons on the blueprint tools and filters in the upgrade planners/deconstruction planners are preserving the original values
      so whenever the mods would be re-added, the original values can be restored, unless the player clears the related icons manually.
    - Any blueprint contents that are not available due to mod removal are also kept in the blueprint persistently, so blueprints
      can be copied and transferred in multiplayer without losing its original data.
    - Added downgrading feature to upgrade planner. It works on blueprints, books and also when applying in the world.
    - Clicking an upgrade planner button in the blueprint or a book now provides a list of all available upgrade planners to be applied.
    - Upgrade planners now also update the relevant icons of blueprints and books.
  Minor Features:
    - Grabbing an item from a blueprint book has the same hand item functionality as when holding an item from inventory, so it
      goes back to the original position when clean cursor is triggered.
  Gui:
    - All the blueprint tools now show all possible actions it can perform in the tooltip.
    - Control settings search now also searches by the currently assigned key-binding.
  Optimizations:
    - Decreased the header size of blueprint-storage and of individual blueprints with backed up modded entities, as only the id mapping
      relevant to the blueprints (and whole storage) is now saved.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that exporting blueprint didn't include the unconfirmed blueprint changes into the exported string.
    - Fixed blueprint preview icons rendering scale when blueprint was held in cursor.
    - Fixed that blueprint was not detecting modded data to be lost when loading unless one of the top level entities or tiles were to be lost.
      This means, that a blueprint with vanilla constant combinator (for example) with a modded signal will no longer silently lose the modded signals on resaving the blueprint storage when the mod is not currently active.
    - Fixed that biters when faced with a rock might get stuck in an infinite pathfinding loop. (https://forums.factorio.com/86552)
    - Fixed that clicking a technology in the research queue, holding the mouse down and moving it over the cancel button would make the cancel button flicker. (https://forums.factorio.com/82014)

    - Fixed that burner assembling machines could cause inserters to get stuck holding extra fuel in some cases. (https://forums.factorio.com/87031)

    - Fixed the changelog GUI indentation.
  Modding:
    - Implemented compileIntoCurrentProcedure for the "if-else-chain" noise expression type. This allows non-constant values to be used as conditions.
    - Added "modulo", "ceil" and "floor" noise expression types.
    - Added "bitwise-and", "bitwise-or", "bitwise-xor" and "bitwise-not" noise expression types.
    - Added "sin", "atan2" and "cos" noise expression types.
    - Added "less-than", "less-or-equal" and "equals" noise expression types.
    - Changed turret base_picture animation to actually play the animation.
    - Added several properties to ExplosionPrototype to control light fading through applying a multiplier to the light's size and intensity.
      "light_intensity_factor_initial" (default 0), "light_intensity_factor_final" (default 0),
      "light_intensity_peak_start_progress" (default 0), "light_intensity_peak_end_progress" (default 0.9),
      "light_size_factor_initial" (default 0.05), "light_size_factor_final" (default 0.1),
      "light_size_peak_start_progress" (default 0.1), "light_size_peak_end_progress" (default 0.5)
  Scripting:
    - Added permission events: on_permission_group_edited, on_pre_permission_string_imported, on_permission_string_imported,
      on_pre_permission_group_deleted, on_permission_group_deleted, and on_permission_group_added.
    - Simplified the rules of entity positions aligned to grid in the blueprint. Now they have the same rules as entities in the world.

      Head and tail segments are now stretched to fill space from source/target position to next segment.
    - Changed how beams apply damage. By default, they no longer trigger their action every damage_interval, instead the action is triggered when
      its owner triggers shooting. The old behavior can be turned on by setting BeamPrototype::action_triggered_automatically to true.
    - It is possible to specify fluid product or ingredient with a fluidbox_index so they use exactly one slot corresponding to the specified fluidbox of the machine.
    - Changed the "market" entity from entity-with-health to entity-with-owner so it now has a force and unit_number.

      to not go through reserved block before exiting the chain sequence.

      when path is changed because of station is being enabled/disabled by a circuit network. (https://forums.factorio.com/68681)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.30
Date: 12. 04. 2019
  Minor Features:
    - Added ability to set a maximum number of map upload slots for multiplayer servers. Setting this is recommended to prevent the server from being flooded with map fragment requests from clients.
  Optimizations:
    - Optimized alt-mode icon background rendering. (https://forums.factorio.com/67280)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.29
Date: 12. 04. 2019
  Changes:
    - Simplified rail building.
      Holding shift while rail building always activates the combination of ghost-rail-building + remove-obstacles, releasing shift returns back to normal manual mode.
      It doesn't matter anymore, whether the rail building started with shift or not.
      This removed the possibility to do ghost-rail-building without the remove-obstacles, but since it seems to be almost useless, we consider it to be worth the simplification.
    - font/color rich text tags now have to be properly terminated. This means eg: "[color=red]Red circuits" will now need to be "[color=red]Red circuits[/color]".
      This fixes a number of issues with handling start/end tags. (https://forums.factorio.com/66263, https://forums.factorio.com/66256)
    - Enter key will be shown as "ENTER" instead of "RETURN" on Windows and Linux. (https://forums.factorio.com/69329)
  Minor Features:

  Bugfixes:
    - After a realization of a big misleading mistake, the pollution per second had to be renamed to pollution per minute, because it is what it actually is. (https://forums.factorio.com/68269)

    - Fixed turret prototype definition allowed ammo_type of attack_parameters to be optional resulting in crash when the turret started to shoot.
    - Don't consider recipes with 0 minimum amount (and possible randomised result) when resolving automatic crafting of ingredients when crafting manually. (https://forums.factorio.com/68836)
  Scripting:
    - Changed the LabelStyle::want_ellipsis default value to true and it is never changed to be something else now. We are considering to even remove this style property
      completely, as we basically want the ellipsis always when the label is squashed.
    - Added tile parameter to on_player_built_tile and on_robot_built_tile.
    - Removed unused on_player_tool_inventory_changed event.
  Modding:
    - Added emissions_per_minute property in the energy source, that is supposed to replace the emissions_per_second_per_watt which was basically wrong and hard to work with,
      both emissions_per_second_per_watt emissions definition will work for some time (at least in 0.17) so mods don't get broken.

Version: 0.17.0
Date: 26. 02. 2019
  Major Features:
    - New quickbar (more in GUI section)
    - Added shortcut bar that allows quick access to certain game features, such as toggling alt mode, creating blueprints, or turning off personal roboport
    - New GUI style with final version of some parts of the GUI (More in GUI section)
    - Added clipboard functionality. (Control + C, Control + X, Control + V activate appropriate tools) Shift + mouse wheel allows to cycle the clipboard history.
    - Added undo functionality (Control + Z). Supports manual entity building and by blueprints and manual mining and usage of deconstruction planner.
    - Reworked the Map Editor so it's now part of the standard game and can be toggled at will using the '/editor' command.
    - Support for mod synchronisation when joining multiplayer game. Works as long as the used mods are on the mod portal.
    - Fight changes. Enemy projectiles are dodgeable and slowdown/damage the target over time. They also leave splashes on ground that have the same effect.
    - Rich text tags. These tags can be used almost anywhere: Chat, station names, save names, custom ui and probably a few places we didn't think of.
      They allow changing color, font, images and location/blueprint/armor/station/locomotive linking through chat. (More in features)
    - Fluid mixing prevention. Actions that fail as they would lead to fluid mixing (like building a pipe, changing recipe, rotating etc.) produce an error message as flying text.
    - Replaced First steps campaign with Introduction campaign, available from the Start campaign menu.
  Features:
    - Trains can be blueprinted and deconstructed.
    - Trains can be given temporary stations (by Control+clicking the map). Temporary station is automatically removed once the train departures from it.
    - Train stops without conditions work as waypoints. (the train doesn't stop at those)
    - Added Passenger present and Passenger not present wait condition to the train conditions.
    - If building of entity/blueprint fails, the reason of it is pinged as flying text.
    - Map pings. Ctrl+Alt+click on the map to show a ping in all players maps at that location.
    - Basic image tags format is [img=<image path>] where image path can use item, entity, technology, recipe, item-group, fluid tile, virtual signal achievement or utility icon.
      For example [img=item/iron-plate] or [img=item.iron-plate]. The "." instead of "/" usage is to make it usable in save names.
      Additionally, items/entities/technologies/recipe/item-group/fluid/tile/virtual signal or achievement can be linked directly by [item=iron-plate], [recipe=iron-plate], or [entity=small-biter] to provide tooltip for the appropriate object.
    - Blueprint/special item tags.
      Shift clicking the icon in chat will create an item and place it in the cursor.
      Format is [special-item=blueprint string], eg:
      [special-item=0eNp1jtEKwjAMRX9l5rnCxkShvyIi3YxboU1Lm4lj9N9N54sv5iFwL/eeZIPBLRiTJQa9gR0DZdDXDbKdyLjq8RoRNFhGDwrI+Ko4GcoxJD4O6BiKAksPfIPuyk0BElu2+CXtYr3T4gdMEvjHUBBDllqgelVQrYJVdqnE/br+eVaBM1ITb0bnQvNMwTc8YzPOhiZ0YTpI5oUp78BL33YnmbY/l/IBb4pSQQ==].
      These tags also work with deconstruction and upgrade planners.
    - Map ping tags: Created by shift-clicking the ground/map when the chat is open. Format is [gps=x,y], eg [gps=10,30] will show a map ping in all players maps at location 10,30.
      Clicking the icon in chat will open the map on the specified location.
    - Font tags: Format is [font=debug-mono]mono text[/font].
    - Color tags: Format is [color=1,0,0]red text[/font]
    - Fast replacing pipes by pipes to ground similar to underground belts.
    - When multiple versions of the same mod are installed you can select which version you want to use.
    - The sync mods with save/multiplayer game feature can now sync mod startup settings as well as mods.
    - Added support to import and export permissions.
    - Closing opened items (blueprint books/armor) now remembers what GUI you previously had open.
    - Filter inserters can be set to whitelist or blacklist filters.
    - Added belt immunity equipment.
    - Added upgrade planner.
    - Added steam networking support for steam users.
    - Added RGB support for Logitech hardware.
    - Robots can blow up cliffs.
    - Wave defense scenario has been reworked to support multiple rounds and a procedurally generated map.
    - Added a research queue that becomes available after the player has finished the game by launching a rocket with satellite.
  Minor Features:
    - Warning icon for automated trains that are out of fuel.
    - Added 250 and 1000 hours precision intervals into statistics.
    - Using deconstruction planner is incorporated in the latency hiding.
    - Changed personal roboports so they won't send construction robots if you're driving in a vehicle that they can't keep up with or if in a train in automatic mode.
    - Added an option to ignore mouse events when using accessibility zoom feature on macOS.
    - Added support to change multiplayer config settings runtime.
    - Added support to edit the whitelist, banlist, and admin list when hosting a multiplayer game.
    - Added the Admin GUI (openable through /admin in the console) to manage multiplayer players.
    - Landfill can be built by robots and be included in blueprints.
    - Blueprint items taken from blueprint library will not move to player inventory when Q is pressed, but can be moved to any slot explicitly. (Same as with clipboard items)
    - When selecting any item to the cursor from some of the player inventories. As long as the item is being held, hand icon is shown on the slot it was taken from. The hand
      prevents any other item to be inserted into the slot as long as the player cursor isn't cleared.
    - When holding radar in cursor, area covered by existing radars is also highlighted on minimap.
    - Configurable (in GUI), the count of rolling stocks shown in the train visualization.
    - Added two levels of shallow water tiles (only placed by map editor, not generated). Enemies and vehicles can travel over shallow water.
  Graphics:
    - New graphics for:
      - accumulator
      - biters, spitters, worms, spawners
      - chests
      - electric poles and substation
      - map edge transitions
      - rocket silo

    - Single vertical pipe is shorter.
  Gui:
    - New final versions of several important GUI screens (Quick bar, Train Schedule, Load/Save Game, Settings, Map Generator, Research, Mods)
      Other screens than the mentioned ones (more than 100) have inconsistencies and will be updated in future minor updates.
    - The quickbar is no longer an inventory, instead it can only hold shortcuts it items in inventory or blueprint library.
      The quickbar now has 10 pages of shortcuts.
      Player inventory increased by 20 slots to compensate. Toolbelt research further increases the player inventory.
    - In the map, station and tag selection is now visualized by the standard Factorio selection box graphics instead of highlighting.
    - Added interface option: When selecting a buildable item from the quickbar or when using the pipette tool, if you have no items of that type, a ghost will be placed in the cursor instead.
    - When something is not buildable (manual or blueprint building), the reason of why it isn't buildable is shown as flying text over the cursor when the build is attempted.
    - Only compatible results of a furnace are manually placeable in the result slot. (Mainly to avoid confusion of new players)
  Optimizations:
    - Modernized and optimized rendering backend. The game now uses DirectX 11 or OpenGL 3.3 Core and requires DirectX 10 class graphics card.
    - DirectX backend doesn't keep backup of all sprites in RAM anymore.
    - Added high quality texture compression to reduce amount of video memory consumed by the game and increase overall rendering performance.
    - Added texture streaming so that adding more sprites does not necessarily increase GPU requirements.
    - Improved game startup performance when using a large amount of technologies with deep dependency trees (it's now 67,000 times faster).
    - Optimized rendering of logistic overlay when zoomed in to map. (https://forums.factorio.com/60659)
    - Optimized rendering of turret ranges when zoomed in to map. (https://forums.factorio.com/58991)
  Changes:
    - Resource generation changed significantly:
      The starting area contains only iron, copper, coal and stone, in very predictable amounts. Uranium and oil are excluded from the starting area.
      Resource generation settings now have a much more dramatic effect. Increased the number of steps for each setting.
      Ore patches are slightly less frequent but richer.
      There will be a more balanced amount of resources within a large enough region.
      Many other small tweaks.
    - Biter generation changed significantly:
      Biter richness slider removed, biter placement is only configured by size and frequency settings.
      Biter generation settings now have a much more dramatic effect. Increased the number of steps for each setting.
      Biter bases will increase in size, frequency and number of worms depending on the distance from player spawn.
      Worm size increases depending on the distance from player spawn.
      Small biter bases are now closer to the player spawn.
      At large distances from player spawn, biter base frequency is lower than before but biter bases are larger.
      Other small tweaks.
    - Terrain generation changed significantly:
      Water is generated as large lakes instead of swamps.
      Tile generation improved. Tile placement respects biomes better.
      More predictable cliff placement.
      Better controls in the map generator GUI for water, tiles and cliffs.
    - New map terrain type selectable: Island. Launch the rocket with only a limited amount of resources available on the map.
    - Default resolution of the game is now 1920x1080.
    - Increased player reach from 6 to 10.
    - Inserters are putting science packs to the lab even when there is no research in progress or when the research doesn't need that particular pack.
    - Default_request_amount removed in all places where it was used. Default logistic request is 1 stack, unless changed by the setting "Default request is 1".
    - All personal equipment stack sizes changed to 20.
    - Placing a tile will now clear any tile ghosts at that position. (https://forums.factorio.com/59721)
    - It is allowed to use unicode characters in save names.
    - Recipes that have more ingredients than the assembling machine allows are now shown as red instead of not present when selecting the recipe.
    - When the "Made in" row is shown in the recipe tooltip, player icon is added to the list when it is craftable by player.
    - Increased ghost time to live of ghosts from 1 hour to 1 week.
    - Since the catalysts have been tweaked, the kovarex enrichment process can now be used together with productivity module.
    - Tile construction jobs are being handled by robots separately from entity building jobs, to prevent entity ghosts not being built due to large number of tile ghosts.
    - Switched key bindings from key codes to scan codes. This solves an issue with bad default key bindings on layouts that are not similar to US QWERTY (ie. AZERTY).
    - Armor no longer uses durability and all armor now has a stack size of 1.
    - Manually putting modules into machines that are requesting modules from the logistic network will reduce the modules requested.
    - Increased maximum train stop length from 50 to 100 characters so it can fit at least 3 tags in most cases.
    - Items consumed by hand crafting are counted in item production statistics.
    - Added --disable-migration-window command-line option to disable the "migrated content" GUI.
    - Removed tile properties debug overlay.

    - Added rotation smoothing to biters.
    - Chests and wooden power poles are no longer usable as fuel.
    - Burner efficiency is set to 100% for all entities and fuel value is halved to simplify calculations. This should not change game balance.
    - Removed the hardness/mining power mechanics, we just have a mining speed and mining time now.
    - Manual mining speed times of various entities will differ a bit, but probably not in a noticeable way.
    - Stone and other ore mining speed has been unified to be 1 (apart uranium ore, which is 2 and shown as 200% mining time)
    - Mining drill speed is now shown in the form of <x>/s (0.25/s for burner mining drill, 0.5/s for electric mining drill), the relative mining
      speeds of the mining machines have been decreased a little so the numbers are rounded nicely (0.28 -> 0.25 and 0.525 -> 0.5).
    - Renamed the whitelist and banlist to server-whitelist and server-banlist.
    - Added server-adminlist that's used to determine which people are admins when hosting any multiplayer game. This is synced both ways when hosting any game.
    - Removed "admins" from the multiplayer server-settings file - they're now handled through server-adminlist.
    - "Z" (drop item) will drop single items into what ever entity is selected instead of only dropping on the ground.
    - Stickers can by applied onto cars and tanks now.
    - Changed the chat gray-out mechanism. It always greyed-out after 5 seconds to 70% alpha, and then stayed depending on the setting. Now it stays 100% and only greys out away in the last 2 seconds.
    - Placing entities or paths removes tree stumps and biter corpses.

Version: 0.16.8
Date: 29. 12. 2017
  Features:
    - Storage chests can be filtered.
  Minor Features:
    - Requester chests can now request stuff from buffer chests as was originally intended. Buffer chests are provided items
      only if all requester chests are satisfied for that specific item.
    - Requester chests have a checkbox that specifies whether it should or shouldn't request things from buffer chests. It is off by default.
  Optimizations:

  Balancing:
    - Changed fluid wagon capacity from 75k to 25k (Same as storage tank).
    - Lowered fluid wagon weight from 3000 to 1000 (same as cargo wagon).
    - Changed fluid wagon recipe so it requires just 1 storage tank instead of 3.

  Modding:

Version: 0.15.27
Date: 03. 07. 2017
  Balancing:
    - Speed and efficiency module 3 technology now requires high tech science packs instead of production science packs,
      so that working towards power armor mk2 does not require production science packs.
      This makes the branching between high tech and production science packs more meaningful.
    - All researches now require equal ratios of science pack types. This reduces the cost of some researches.

  Changes:
    - Added headless server option --server-id to allow specifying custom path to the server ID file.
    - Increased the minimum custom UI scale from 50% to 80% to avoid some scaling issues.
    - The zoom level at which the map switches from 'map view' to 'world view' was increased.
    - The first level of infinite researches is not needed for the tech maniac achievement anymore.
    - The game will default to low sprite quality on computers with less than 2.5GB RAM. (https://forums.factorio.com/47525)

    - Removed the zoom-to-world-outside-coverage debug option because it was causing issues. (https://forums.factorio.com/47442)
    - Added "create specialized sprite atlases" option to graphics settings. If checked, tile and shadow sprites won't be put into separated sprite atlases
      instead of the main one. This should give graphics driver more room to fit required sprites to graphics memory.
    - Added "atlas texture size" option to graphics settings. Larger atlas texture can fit more sprites into single atlas which reduces CPU load when rendering.
      But smaller atlases are more likely to fit into VRAM and reduce GPU load when rendering.

    - It is possible to upgrade modules to more powerful variant in machine by fast entity transfer.
    - Clear cursor first cancels the current action (rail building, wire dragging, blueprint/deconstruction), and only removes the item from the cursor when pressed again.
    - Saving a game changes selected name and directory for next saves. (https://forums.factorio.com/19461)
    - Clicking different filtered slot in quickbar will try to clear the currently selected quickbar item if possible.

    - Inventory filter slots can be copy-pasted from empty slots onto empty slots using the stack transfer/split controls (shift + left click, shift + right click by default).
  Balancing:
    - The productivity module pollution addition was lowered (30%->5%, 40%->7.5%, 50%->10%), as the pollution generated by the machine is already increased
      by the additional energy production and time, it doesn't need to be so high as the modules are quite expensive already.
    - Repair packs have double durability (100->200) and stack size (50->100).
    - Changed stack size of raw wood (50->100) so it doesn't fill the inventory so quickly.
    - Roboport have decreased transmission power consumption (200kw->50kw) while the robots (and their recharging) has increased power consumption (200kW per recharge slot to 1Mw per slot)
      Basically, covering area by roboports is cheaper, but using robots for transport is more expensive. To keep the personal roboport usefulness, energies used in personal roboport have been
      all multiplied by 10.
    - Inserters are able to squeeze things "slightly" better to belts. more resources.
    - Increased size of several green science and few blue science technologies.
    - Increased inventory size of cargo wagon. (30->40)
    - Oil yield drains to 10% two times slower.
    - Big and behemoth enemies spawn 50% slower.
    - Armor resistances are applied before the energy shield is used.
    - Increased the ghost time to live when something is destroyed from 5 + 5 minutes to 30 + 30 minutes.
    - Halved the mining time of rails, rail signals and walls.
    - Changed the way evolution factor approaches the maximum (1).
      The addition of evolution factor was changed from addition * (1 - evolution) to addition * (1 - evolution)^2
      This means that the progress gets more slower towards the high values.
    - Balanced train acceleration and top speed, additional wagons no longer slow trains so strongly.
    - Changed the amount of items requested when copy-pasting assembling machines to requester chests for several recipes.
    - Express underground belts require lubricant to match the express belts and express splitters.
    - Increased battery equipment power storage, input, and output by a factor of 20.
  Changes:
    - Reduced number of connections drawn between roboports in blueprint and roboports on map.
    - More virtual signals for combinators.
    - Virtual signals can be used in blueprint icons.

    - Ghosts created by player no longer expire and can be placed before researching any technologies.
    - Ghosts are brighter and easier to see.
    - Alert of destroyed entity exists 2 times longer.
    - Quickbar filters are set and unset using the same key.
    - Loading a scenario without control.lua will automatically load the freeplay game mode scripts.
      This means new maps created in the map editor will get the freeplay game mode.
    - Loading a scenario in the map editor will preserve it's scripts.
      This means custom freeplay/sandbox maps can be created in-game.
    - Constant combinator can be rotated.
    - All types of inserters can be controlled by the circuit and logistic network, once the respective network is researched.
    - All types of chests can be connected to the circuit network. Smart Chest was removed from the game.
    - Decider combinator "input count" option makes the combinator copy the count of the specified output signal from the input signals,
      instead of copying the count from the condition. This might break some setups. https://forums.factorio.com/13706
    - Transport belt connectable entities will disconnect from incoming (and all other) belts when marked for deconstruction.
      The problem is solves is described in this bug report: https://forums.factorio.com/19038

Version: 0.12.11
Date: 16. 10. 2015
  Features:
    - Added --no-auto-pause: When running as a server, --no-auto-pause will prevent stopping the game when no players are connected.
  Optimizations:
    - Optimised the particle performance. Helps during heavy fights.
  Changes:
    - Showing the log file location when the game crashes, so it is easier to find when reporting the bug.
    - The "graphics.force-opengl" option default value is true when AMD graphics card is present.

  Scripting:
    - Changed LuaSurface::set_multi_command signature. Now the function takes a table with following keys:
      command(required), unit_count(required), force(optional), unit_search_distance(optional)
      This solves issue with not finding any enemies to attack: https://forums.factorio.com/16541
    - Removed game.on_save function. There should be no need for it and it was causing too many problems.
    - Lua on_load function is not called when saving the game anymore. It is called only on actual load now.
    - Lua API calls on_load, on_init, on_configuration_changed, on_event and generate_event_name
      have been moved to a new namespace called script (so from now use script.on_load(...)). This will break many mods!
      The callback registered in on_load function doesn't have access to the game API. This is to avoid common desyncs.
      The on_init and on_configuration_changed still retain the access to the game API.
    - on_configuration_changed is fired when the map version changes, a mod version changes, a mod is added, or a mod is removed and passes "data":
      Pushes old_version="x.x.x", new_version="x.x.x" when loading map versions other than the current version
      When a mod version is changed it appears as a table of mod changes: {["Mod name"] = {old_version="x.x.x", new_version="x.x.x"}, ...}
      When a mod is added it appears as: ["Mod name"] = {old_version=nil, new_version="x.x.x"}
      When a mod is removed it appears as: ["Mod name"] = {old_version="x.x.x", new_version=nil}
    - Changed LuaGameScript::makefile to LuaGameScript::write_file and added an optional third parameter bool to append.
  Modding:
    - Replaced entity type "rail" with types "straight-rail" and "curved-rail". Property "bending_type" is optional for rail entities,
      but is still mandatory for rail remnants.

Version: 0.12.1
Date: 24. 07. 2015
  Features:
    - Burner inserters start with enough energy to pick up 1 item and fuel them selfs.
  Changes:
    - Train station names use natural string comparing (station "Iron 10" comes after "Iron 9", not after "Iron 1").
    - New command-line parameter: --latency-ms. Allows to set server latency in milliseconds rather than ticks
    - You can copy paste circuit network conditions between Inserter, Lamp, Pump and Offshore Pump.
    - The delete button in Load Game or Save Game dialogs now asks for confirmation before deleting
    - Locomotive on schedule can't be rotated while moving anymore.
    - Changed fast inventory transfer from the main player inventory so ctrl+clicking empty slots doesn't move items to the logistic trash slots.
    - Changed Assembling machine's auto-insertion behaviour when using speed module effects. Faster speed with fast recipes will insert more items sooner.

  Scripting:
    - LuaSurface::set_multi_command now takes an optional third argument specifying the force to send the command to. Default is the enemy force
    - Default mods are always enabled if mod-list.json is lost (even when enable new mods option is disabled).
    - LuaSurface can be invalid when read from LuaPlayer and Player entity if the player is disconnected from the game (MP disconnect) - use LuaSurface.valid to check.
      Note: LuaSurface currently never switches between valid and not valid so the check only has to be done when it's first read from the LuaPlayer.
    - Changed default maximum range of projectiles from 10^308 to 1000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.12.0
Date: 17. 07. 2015
  Major Features:
    - The game is now finished by launching the rocket with satellite.
    - Added chain signals, they can be used to make more complicated junctions and stations without deadlocks.
    - Added personal roboport as modular armor equipment.
      Once it is active, it uses the materials and robots in the players inventory.
      It supports all the tasks construction robots can do like building blueprints, repairing structures, deconstruction etc.
    - Added logistic trash fields to the character GUI.
      They supply items into the logistic system in the same way active provider chests do.
    - Added combinators (Arithmetic Combinator, Decider Combinator and Constant combinator).
      These allow more advanced manipulation with the circuit network logic (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-88)
    - Multiplayer latency hiding (gives impression that some common tasks are performed immediately)
      Applies to character movement, mining buildings, building, fast replacing, opening guis, etc.
    - Stone brick can be used to build stone path. (30% walking speed increase).
    - Concrete can be created.
      The concrete can be used to build concrete floors (40% walking speed increase).
    - Terrain modifies vehicle friction force (sand: 1.8, grass: 1.6, dirt: 1.4, stone path: 1.1, concrete: 0.8).
    - The Lamp, Storage Tank, Small Pump and Offshore Pump can be connected to the circuit network.
  Features:
    - Trees degenerate slowly when there high pollution levels.
    - Lab research is now continuous. Science packs have progress bars of usage.
      This means that 20 labs doing research with 10 units will still be faster than 10
      labs and the science packs aren't wasted.
    - Assembling machine input slot can contain more than the usual stack size when the recipe requirement demands it (3 X recipe demand).
      Example: The rocket silo requires 1000 steel, while the stack size is 100, but the input stack can hold enough.
    - Added / updated sounds for biters, spitters, worm, spawner, flamethrower, tank, lasers, etc.
    - New ambient soundtrack added.
      Added mechanism that prevents playing track that was played recently.
      The ambient player alternates between neutral wind/environment sounds and soundtrack songs.
    - Mousing over a train will show you its current path and blocks it can't enter.
    - Locomotives now show the contents of attached cargo wagons in their tooltip.
    - Trees regenerate health slowly.
    - Added support for transferring contents/settings when fast-replacing all entity types.
    - Added modules to the alt-view for entities that support modules.
    - Factorio can run as a dedicated server without graphics (http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Multiplayer#Headless_server).
    - Basic PvP: New forces can now be created and merged back together; a cease-fire can be agreed upon between forces
    - IPv6 support for multiplayer.
    - DNS names can be used when connecting to multiplayer game.
    - Enabled mining trees/ghosts while holding blueprints to be built.
    - Added explosive cannon shells.
    - Building blueprints over existing ghosts restores the ghost time to live to full.
  Changes:
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.9.0 version (You can use 0.9.8 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - Removed rocket defense entity.
    - Items on transport belts don't go off the belt at the end, so the transport belt has
      to go directly in front of the required inserter.
    - Reduced number of rendered Roboport connections.
    - The trade in the marketplace only happens if the player can accept the trade items.
    - Inserters can now extract from Roboports and Beacons.
    - Inserters now take items from right behind them, not from the center of the pickup target entity.
    - Copy entity settings mechanism now remembers only the last entity copied from.
      Also mechanism allows copy/paste across different entities of the same type (i.e. assembling machine 1 -> assembling machine 2) and
      from assembling machines to requester chests (sets filters to 2 x requirements of the assembling machine).
    - Trees have generally smaller bounding boxes, so it is easier to walk through forest.
    - Power armor modules generate and consume 100 times more power in order to be able to charge construction robots.
    - The construction robots don't build gate in the gap between the rolling stock vehicles. They wait for the train to get away.
    - Player's logistic filters are now remembered after respawn in multiplayer
    - All turrets are now 4x4; laser turrets are 4x more expensive and powerful, gun turrets are 2x more expensive
    - Roboport tooltip now shows correct numbers of construction and logistic robots separately.
    - When a train loses a path and cannot find a new one, it stops immediately. This prevents it from riding into parts of the rail network, from where it can't find a path.
    - Improvements to circuit network wire connection. You can connect multiple wires of the same color to the same entity.
    - The autosave dialog no longer cancels an active blueprint or deconstruction planner selection if the mouse button is still held after the autosave finishes
    - Number of autosave slots is now configurable through config.ini (no GUI).
  Optimizations:
    - Overall optimisation of train + belt heavy factories is roughly 66% compared to 0.11,
      this means that the game runs 3 times faster.
    - Optimised the transport belt movement.
    - Optimised the rotated bounding box collisions checks (trains).
    - Optimised the smoke update.
    - Optimised the solar panel, all the solar panel input is merged, so the count doesn't matter.
    - Optimised the accumulators by merging then into groups, where typical factory has 1 group per network.
    - Optimised the land mine activation mechanism.
    - Smaller multiplayer heartbeat packet size.
    - Optimised adding/removing of roboport, robots keep their tasks if they can.
    - Path finder will terminate when search is too long. This avoids save explosions (see https://forums.factorio.com/12580).
    - Optimised rendering for large logistic networks.
    - Fixed that the graphics were saved twice in the RAM memory.
  Graphics:
    - New graphics of the combat robots.
    - New graphics of the laser/gun turrets, their color is now player/force dependent.
    - New graphics of muzzle flash for player, car, tank and turrets.
    - New tree graphics. Trees have 4 levels of leaves and the leaves are colorable.
    - Trees emit leaves (based on the tree color) when being mined and destroyed.
    - Trees emit branches when mined or destroyed.
    - Storage tank has a small window showing the liquid inside.
    - Combat robots attack beam (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-84)
    - New GUI icons: Weapons, ammo, status icons such as out-of-ammo or out-of-electricity
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong item count in the logistic system when handling partially-filled magazines, repair packs or other items with durability
    - Fixed the choppy (not smooth) movement when using the exoskeleton equipment.
    - item-description localization now displays correctly when previewing recipes.
    - entity-description localization now displays on entities.
    - Proper blueprint centering. It is based on the included entities rather then the selection rectangle when the blueprint is created.
    - Very big entities no longer disappear at the edge of the screen

    - Fixed crash when removing electric poles from electric networks or circuit networks with large amounts of poles (https://forums.factorio.com/13368).
    - Fixed video-memory-usage option on Windows. It is possible to run Factorio on configurations with low VRAM (less then 512MB). Other platforms don't have this issue.
    - Fixed that control-clicking entire inventory into a machine installed modules.
    - Fixed another instance of the "Trying to make chunk at unreasonable position" bug (https://forums.factorio.com/13399).
    - Requester chests no longer request more than they can store. E.g. if a requester chest only has one free slot and the requester slider is set to request 20000 iron ore, the chest will only request one stack from the network (https://forums.factorio.com/4604)

    - Fixed crashes (mainly while saving) related to train with lost path trying to unlock gates on the path.
    - Solved that inventory was not sorted after crafting in god mode.
    - Solved that inventory was not sorted after another stack of items was moved to cursor when building, or
      when ammo stack was moved to gun slots from inventory when the previous slot was depleted.
    - Fixed that transport belts were still animating and emitting sounds even when they were stopped and prepared
      for deconstruction.
    - Fixed that construction robots, when deconstructing splitters/belts to ground didn't remove the items on these
      the same way as on regular transport belts first. The result was random items leftovers after deconstruction.
  Optimizations:
    - Reduced the cpu load caused by big count of inserters loading/unloading transport belts.
      Can reduce the update time on big factories by about 30%.
  Scripting:
    - Fixed various problems in the lua blueprint interface.
    - All the entity specific settings that can be specified in blueprint creation are now
      specifiable also at entity creation like game.create_entity{name="wooden-chest", bar=5, position = {0, 0}}
    - Fixed the problems related to setting the blueprint icons from script.
  Modding:
    - Disabled adding empty string as prerequisite of technology.

      Now it removes just GUI of mods that were removed as before.
    - Fixed that rail over gate (or the other way around), wasn't buildable as part of the blueprint, as the first one

    - Fixed that the exe file in the zip package was missing the factorio icon.
    - Fixed that the menu in map editor was not responsible after clicking exit and cancel.

    - Lua debug library no longer return paths containing installation directory.
  Modding:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.11.1
Date: 31.10. 2014
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed test code leftover that artificially created desync every 20 seconds.
    - Fixed the localisation errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.11.0
Date: 31.10. 2014
  Major Features:
    - First version of the multiplayer.
      Only co-op mode. Simplistic UI. Requires a public IP address for connecting to.
      Tested mostly on LAN. Replays of MP games don't work yet. Number of players is not limited.
    - Added gates, they open when friendly player comes by. Gates built on straight rails become rail gates.
    - Added a tank. It is way more durable than a car. It has its own set of weapons.
    - Added spitters. They are a next evolution step of biters with a ranged (spitting) attack.
      They are spawned in their own spawners (different mask color) but only after evolution reaches 0.3.
  Features:
    - The console works as a chat tool by default now.
      Ingame commands can be used, /w for whisper or /c for lua command (previous functionality). For more type /help.
    - Highlight of the items added into the inventory (https://forums.factorio.com/3189)
    - Randomized lights turning on and off during dawn and dusk (https://forums.factorio.com/3493)
    - Item entities are now deconstructable.
    - Added a cancel deconstruction option to the deconstruction planner.
    - Copy/paste entity settings (filters) for cargo wagons (like e.g. recipes for assembling machines).
  Bugfixes:
    - Loads of determinism fixes, mainly for the multiplayer, but the replay stability should improve a lot as well.
    - When game speed is < 1 the GUI doesn't lag.
    - Fixed crash when trying to connect trains in a situation that would result in collision of the new train with other trains
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5853).
    - Fixed invalid directions in game.create_entity() crashing the game.
    - Calling game.take_screenshot{} no longer crashes the game.
    - Fixed that some entities weren't placeable in the map editor (worm corpses).
    - Fixed incorrectly disabled New game -> Custom scenario -> Confirm button.
    - Fixed that turret could be walked over when rebuilt until the game was reloaded.
    - Accidental building is now not possible when viewing the map.
    - Compatibility fix of the new OS X Yosemite.
    - Syntax error in script locale is now shown ingame, without closing the program.
    - Fixed crash when placing blueprints with wires over existing ghosts with wires (https://forums.factorio.com/5966)
    - Fixed the rail segment bug, when mod adds two same rails at the same position.
  Graphics:
    - New player animation. Three levels depending on the armor. All with masks.
    - Rail endings.
    - Biters/Spitters/Spawners/Worms are now drawn using the same picture with differently colored masks.
      This allows making different color combinations of biters without rising the video memory requirements.(Mods!)
    - Blood splashes when units die are now procedural.
  Balancing:
    - Stone walls need research (just red science packs needed).
    - Slower crafting (0.5s->10s) of solar panels and accumulators.
    - Fast/Express splitter are made from the lower variants (same as with transport belts/underground belts)
    - Small electric pole can be used as fuel.
    - Changed wood fuel value from (0.6MJ->2MJ), so 2X wood made from raw wood has the same fuel value as the original raw wood.
  Optimizations:
    - Faster map drawing.
    - Optimized main loop. The game will automatically skip rendering when it can't keep up with expected updates per second.
      LowFPS mode has been removed because this functionality fully replaces it (it automatically lowers FPS when needed).
    - Added Bitmap Memory Caching. This allows to store certain sprites classes (defined by priority) in RAM and load them only when needed.
      If your computer has little VRAM try setting "Bitmap Caching Level" (in GraphicsSettings) to "very low".
      This will keep the trains / player and enemies dying animations in RAM, saving a lot of VRAM.
  Changes:
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.7.0 version (You can use 0.7.5 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - New physics for cars. Car now does very little damage when colliding.
    - Disabled shooting from a vehicle (capsules can still be thrown).
  Modding:
    - Added phases to the mod loading. data.lua of all mods is loaded first, then the data-updates.lua and the data-final-fixes.lua as last.
      This allows mods to change the data of other mods without the need to be last. This is used even in the base game, to add the
      dust effect when a building is created, so the effect is added to mod buildings as well.
    - Every animation / sprite can now have a color tint.
    - Every animation / sprite can have any number of "overlays" (see how player masks work).
    - Changed the frame_width/frame_height properties of animation to width/height so it is the same as in sprite.
    - Better specification for enemy spawner units (see biter-spawner for example).
    - Furnace and assembling machine have been internally united. They the the same animation and quite a few properties
      (crafting_categories, energy_usage, crafting_speed, animation, working_visualisations).
      As a result Furnace can now have fluid boxes and use recipes with multiple outputs (but not multiple inputs).
    - Extended car prototypes to make tanks possible.
    - Electric turret uses ammo_type directly from its attack_parameters.
    - Attack parameters accept warmup field which defines the delay before the effects take place (but animation and sound start playing instantly).
      This is now used for spitter shooting animation only.
  Scripting:
    - Lua API for writing / reading player color (i.e. game.player.color = {r=0.7, g=0.4, b=0.3})
    - Fixed saving and loading references to LuaEntity and LuaItem prototypes.
    - Fixed crash when calling game.set_tiles() with invalid parameters.
    - Added New LuaFluidBox object to interact with liquids.
    - Lua API for reading backer names of entities (and writing station-names).
    - Expansion of get_circuit_condition-method; the returned table contains a new key "fulfilled" which
      indicates if condition is met.
    - Expansion of get/set/clear-filter methods to allow access to cargo wagon filters
    - Changed onplayercrafted; it is now called for every item in the crafting queue crafted
    - Added new events:
      on_robot_built_entity: passes entity built
      on_robot_pre_mined: identical to on_preplayer_mined_item but called by robots
      on_robot_mined: identical to on_player_mined_item
      on_research_started: passes the research name
      on_research_finished: passes the research finished
      on_player_rotated_entity: passes the entity rotated
      on_marked_for_deconstruction: passes the entity
      on_canceled_deconstruction: passes the entity
      on_trigger_created_entity: passes the entity created; only called if the trigger creating the entity has been marked with "trigger_created_entity = true"
      on_train_changed_state: passes the train
    - Added show_entity_info parameter to take_screenshot.
    - Function gettext was removed completely, localised strings are now specified by the curly-brackets {"key", {"key-parameter"}, "literal parameter", 7}
    - Added disconnect_neighbour: used with electric poles; takes the circuit connector to disconnect - none to disconnect standard copper wire.
    - Added ghost-related methods:
      ghost_name read: the ghost entity name
      ghost_localised_name read: the localised ghost entity name
      ghost_type read: the ghost entity type
      ghost_prototype read: the ghost entity prototype
      time_to_live read/write: the number of ticks until the ghost dies
    - Expanded direction and recipe to provide write access
    - Expanded methods to support reading/writing from ghost entities: (connect_neighbour, disconnect_neighbour, direction, get_circuit_condition, set_circuit_condition,
      clear_circuit_condition, orientation, rotateable, recipe, backer_name)
    - Changed set_circuit_condition parameters to: {circuit = index, operator = operator, name = name, count = count}
    - Added Lua API for reading/writing information from special items (ammo, armor, blueprints, tools)
    - Added Lua API for reading/writing armor equipment and equipment grids
    - Expanded methods for trains:
      locomotives read: returns the locomotives for the train
      state read: returns the current train state (train states are defined in defines.trainstate)
    - Lua objects can now be passed between scripts with remote.call().
      If an invalid object is passed the destination interface receives nil in place of the object.
    - Added game.players[] - returns a table of the current players
    - Expanded player-related methods to pass "player_index" of the player doing the action. If there is no player (map editor) the "player_index" value will be nil.
      (on_picked_up_item, on_built_entity, on_player_mined_item, on_preplayer_mined_item, on_player_createditem, onplayerrotatedetity)
    - Added "player_index" read to LuaGuiElement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.10.12
Date: 16.9. 2014
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to set a filter.
    - Fixed that fast replacing moved items primary to character, it made upgrading chests and machines not practical.
      Instead, when fast replacing, the content is always transferred to the new entity, when it can't fit, it transfers
      to player, and if it can't be moved to the player as well it makes the good old item bomb.
    - The right ui container is slightly larger, so it can contain the roboport info without enlarging.
    - The worm turrets are not taken into consideration when deciding enemy expansions.
    - Fixed that enemy expansion candidates were not updated correctly when base was destroyed.
    - Fixed that combat robots were on the map/minimap.
    - Fixed extra mouse buttons over GUI behavior (https://forums.factorio.com/5810).
  Balancing:
    - The maximum distance for enemy expansion was increased from 5 to 7.
  Scripting:
    - makefile, take_screenshot and remove_path now use logger to report failures, minor fixes in the path verification

    - Fixed that the blueprint preview could go outside the window in some cases (https://forums.factorio.com/5753).
    - Fixed the crash when the selection window of filter slots of cargo wagon is opened while the cargo wagon gets away (or id destroyed) and the

Date: 12.9. 2014
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that passive provider chest acted as active provider chest after game load.
    - Fixed that player turrets could be walked through after reconstructed. (https://forums.factorio.com/5618).
    - Fixed that the starting chest in sandbox mode didn't contain some of the items in full stacks.
    - Fixed that the pause game control reset itself to default after every restart.
    - Fixed wrong directory name inside save (it was "currently-saving", now it is the same as the save name).
    - Fixed that map2scenario didn't copy locale and script state to the scenario.
    - Fixed crash related to enemy pathfinding.
    - Fixed wrongly reported amount of items the player got from mining machines/containers (https://forums.factorio.com/5688).
    - Fixed entity icons of defender/distractor/destroyer robots.
    - Fixed that deconstructing transport-belt-to-ground would delete items they held (https://forums.factorio.com/5667).
    - Fixed that deconstructing inserters holding items would delete items they held (https://forums.factorio.com/5636).
    - The notifications of destroyed buildings are created only when someone other than player (or his machines) destroys the building.
      This affects player destroying his buildings manually and also land-mine destroying itself on impact.
    - Fixed that slightly more robots than needed could be send to empty provider chest (https://forums.factorio.com/5613).
    - When unresearching (using script) the toolbelt, the items that can't fit it are inserted back into the player's inventory.
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5659).
    - Recipes changed by mod will be refreshed to original value automatically when the mod is removed
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5676).
    - Fixed crash when opening save that contained mods that are not already present.
      Crash happened when the crafting menu was opened and the active crafting group was added by the mod (so it is not present anymore).
    - Fixed that items were moved into quickbar even when there was already stack of that type in the quickbar (currently selected in hand)
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5661)
    - Fixed the missing check of gun->ammo compatibility when putting the gun there using shift-click or when the gun was crafted.
      (http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/posting.php?mode=reply&t=5682).
    - Fixed that the visualisation radius of throwables (the green circle) wasn't visible when the player was in the vehicle.
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5595).
    - Fixed that the container's inventory didn't get sorted in case the container couldn't be mined because all the items wouldn't fit the inventory.
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5614).
    - Fixed crash during enemy attack when the enemy unit was modded to attack by destroying everything including itself. (https://forums.factorio.com/5727)
    - Fixed that the player mined item event was not called when they got just part of the inventory (https://forums.factorio.com/5608).
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to start fullscreen game in other than the primary window. There is now settings in config in category [graphics] section:
      preffered-screen-index. Changing the value changes the display adapter (monitor) that is used. If many people use this feature in the future, we can put it in the
      graphics settings ingame as well (https://forums.factorio.com/5048).
    - The number input box "consumes" only numeric input. Other keys for walking or closing the window still work when the field is selected.
      This is true as long as these are not mapped to numbers, bad luck in that case (https://forums.factorio.com/5741)
    - Fixed that actions made in the last tick before closing the scenario due to error were applied again when different game was opened. (https://forums.factorio.com/5741).
  Debug:
    - Added option to turn off vertical synchronisation of the display (v-sync).
    - Fixed crash when starting game without config file.
  Gui:
    - Progress bar showing electricity availability is now colored. Green for all required energy available, yellow, more than half, red less than half.
  Modding:
    - Progress bar style enables to specify different colors for different ranges of values.
  Scripting:
    - Added game.get_chunks() iterator and game.is_chunk_generated(...) and game.player.force.is_chunk_charted() methods.
    - Pre player mined item event is called really before the player starts to get items from the inventory.
      Note that the change means, that the event is called even when the mine can eventually fail
      (not enough inventory to hold all the items). In the future, we might add an event for when the entity is really going to be removed.

      (https://forums.factorio.com/5511).
    - Removed so called "item bomb" effect. It happened When the player tried to a mine chest that contained items that couldn't fit his inventory.

      gets as many items from the chest as possible.
    - Fixed performance when cancelling large crafting queues and the player has no room to hold the items.
      This also fixes performance when a loot-enabled entity dies and drops a large amount of loot.
    - Fixed bug when sometimes rail segments were messed up by placing rail signals from blueprint (https://forums.factorio.com/5350).
      Also blueprint which would place two signals next two each other cannot be placed.

      (https://forums.factorio.com/3088)
    - The created effect of entities is not applied in map editor, to avoid too much frozen smoke particles at the same time that slows the render.
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5492).
    - Worms don't collide with the world during the dying animation (https://forums.factorio.com/5409).
    - Worms don't show health bar and don't regenerate health during the dying animation.
    - Fixed scrolling with sliders in game (https://forums.factorio.com/5392).
    - Fixed bug when some controls didn't work with mouse over the GUI (https://forums.factorio.com/5130).

    - Fixed that the number in the logistic GUI wasn't set to 0 when the slot was cleared (https://forums.factorio.com/5565).
    - Map map2scenario reports errors correctly instead of crashing.
    - Using map2scenario no longer resets researched technologies and unlocked recipes.
    - Migrations are applied even when using map2scenario.
    - Fixed bug when blueprints were "looting" the items from transport belt to grounds (https://forums.factorio.com/5587).
  Debug:

    - Old save file is not overwritten when saving fails (https://forums.factorio.com/5354).

      For requester chests, robots take always as much as they can carry and leave it in the chest, so it can get a bit more than requested.
    - Consistent stack sizes for guns.
    - Lights rendering quality can be set in the graphics settings.

      roboport in the trunk. Saves corrupted this way from earlier versions are not loadable.
  Changes:
    - Changed the priority of resupplying source of logistic robots.
      provider has biggest priority, then storage and the last one is passive provider.
      This is to avoid uncontrolled filling of storage chests from the leftovers.

Version: 0.9.0
Date: 14.2. 2014
  Major Features:
    - Blueprints. Blueprint item allows the player to select the area that will be copied into the item.
      The player can customise the icons that will represent the blueprint.
      While building blueprints, player can rotate these, and they can also overlap with existing entities as long as they match.
    - Deconstruction tool. Allows player to order construction robots to deconstruct buildings in the selected area.
      When the buildings contain items (chests, transport belts etc.) construction robots first move these items out of it and place it
      into the logistics network.
    - Oil industry.
      Pumpjacks mine the crude oil from the oil spills.
      Oil refinery processes the crude oil to oil fractions.
      Chemical plant processes the oil fractions to useful products.
    - Added fluid storage tank.
    - Added electric onshore pump (can speed up the fluid or push the fluid against the slope).
    - Logistic network condition for smart inserters. Takes the sum of all items in storage/provider chests into consideration.
  Features:
    - Biomes. Gives more variation to the nature, tends to generate similar types of vegetation close together.
    - Recipe GUI contains even recipes not craftable by player (their tooltip shows machines where they can be crafted).
    - Copying entity settings (replaces the old shift build functionality).
      Shift + left click sets the selected entity as a copy source, shift + right click applies the settings to selected entity.
    - Ghost buildings can be built (shift + right click) and mined individually.
    - Saves directory can contain custom sub directories. Added delete save button.
    - Game saves and mods are read / written natively to the zip files.
    - CTRL in the text fields including dev console (CTRL + left/right = jump word, CTRL + backspace = delete word, CTRL + up/down = home/end).
    - Roboports have separate logistic radius (now 25) and construction radius (now 50).
    - Player gets separate warning icon when building is destroyed.
    - Warning icons tooltip shows list of entities that are under attack/destroyed/attacking.
    - Highlight inventory slots that contains results of the recipe the player already have when they are hovering the recipe slot.
    - Added / updated sounds for player actions (building, mining buildings, crafting, inventory move, GUI click, etc.)
    - Optional ordering of items sub-categories into individual lines in the crafting window.
  Graphics:
    - New pipes graphics.
    - All not connected pipe connections have ending visualisation.

    - Doodads, small decorative objects that appear in the environment (grass chunks, trees, small bushes, rocks etc).
    - Area visualizations (for electric poles, roboports, beacons, mining drills) are displayed under the entities.
    - Roboports visualization density adds up only to a limit.
    - Pipes show the fluid inside in the alt mode.
    - Only every second pipe in the row has the window.
    - Nicer rail diagonals/turns on minimap.
  Optimizations:
    - Optimisation of the logistic network update - slow performance with many robots with cargo and no place to put it.
    - Optimisation of the electric network update by the factor of 5.
    - Optimisation of inserters update, inserters that have nothing to do are set to sleep and woke up when their target/source changes.
    - Turrets don't search for enemies when there are no enemies nearby.
    - Logistic network doesn't go through empty provider chests/satisfied requester chests any more, so they don't slow down the update.
    - Only chunks with changes are re-charted, so the limit of 2 re-charted chunks per ticks is applied only on chunk that actually changed,
      this allows to have much higher areas covered by radars.
    - Optimisation of the building electric poles by dragging (It could get slow for big networks).
    - Small optimisation of transport belt movement.
  Balancing:

    - The factory now produces pollution. Pollution is visible on the map after pressing ALT key.
      Pollution is mostly produced by mining drills, things that burn coal, assembling machines and modules.
    - Enemy creepers were replaced by small, medium and big biters.
    - Enemy turrets were replaced by small, medium and big shooting worms.
    - Enemy attacks are triggered by pollution accumulated around their base (no time based attacks from the script anymore).
    - Enemies move and attack in groups.
    - Enemies can create new bases.
    - Added new weapons / ammos: shotgun, combat shotgun, explosive rockets.
    - Added concept of capsules (usable items). Capsules are used from quickbar.
      Quickbar shortcut (1-5 shift 1-5) applies the capsule at mouse position.
      Current capsules: basic grenade, poison cloud capsule (doesn't damage buildings),
                        slowdown capsule (doesn't work on buildings), combat robot capsules (spawns robot(s) that fight the enemies)
  Features:
    - Enemies wander around their base when they have nothing to do.
    - Enemies call for help when attacked.
    - Added upgrades (research) for all types of ammo and for laser turrets as well.

    - "Shift-build" - when building with shift the settings of the last built entity of that type are applied.
      This works for assembling machine, smart/logistics chest and inserter, includes circuit network wiring and internal settings.
    - Laboratories and mining drills are module compatible.
    - Logistic robots try to not mix different items in storage chests if possible.
    - Placing resources now uses the "autoplace" mechanism as well (see lua data files).

      frequency and size are less dependent on each other.
    - Automatic updates can use proxy server.
  Gui:
    - Extended tips and tricks.
    - Mark missing elemental ingredients in the recipe tooltip as red.

    - Long hand inserter puts the item into the distance 2 (instead of 1).
    - Decreased the car health from 2000 to 500, laser from 350 to 250.
    - Increased the wall health bar from 200 to 350 and increased health of most of the player structures.
    - Enemy spawners and turrets slowly regenerate health.
    - Electric pole connects to all poles in the reach with no common neighbour. The limit of 5 connection per pole stays.
      Building electric poles with shift pressed builds it without any connections.
  Bugfixes:
    - Straight belt pushes items from the center to one of the sides, so randomly inserted items on belt
      shouldn't get stuck in the U turns.
    - Indestructible objects are now handled properly in the path finding.

    - The game doesn't crash when unlock recipe modifier is used in market, although, the
      GUI interface should be upgraded. (Price is not shown in the tooltip, and is not understandable
      that you are not buying the item, but the recipe. There is no indication, when you already

      research and enabled state of technologies, so it is usable in migrations to reload existing technologies that changed.
    - Enabled to have recipe with no prerequisites (just energy). In the crafting GUI, it shows Infinite count craftable
      of that item (and all items dependent on recipes that are for free).

      error instead of crashing, or writing error -1)
    - Changed the GUI interface to minimise mod conflicts.
      GUI object contains now 3 accessible sub object (top, left, center).
      These are always flows and can't be removed, when more than one mod (and/or script)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 29.3. 2013
  Major Features:
    - Added walls. (Walls are made from stone bricks, these are created from stone in the furnace.)
  Features:
    - Game updates are using timer event. The program keeps 60 game updates even with FPS < 60 or FPS > 60.
      The "catchup rate" is configurable. When the FPS drops very low this stops having the effect.
    - Storing console history in the player data.
  Graphics:
    - New tree graphics (8 dry trees  12  big trees)
    - New inserter graphics
    - New laser turret and gun turret graphics
    - Bullet particles for gun turret
    - New solar panel graphics
    - Lighter stone furnace graphics
    - New logistic robot graphics
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when restarting the game with technology GUI opened.
    - Fixed crafting queue properties when saved during crafting.
    - Fixed laser turret not consuming energy in idle state.
    - Splitter has maximum memory of 5 items when forced to send items on one side because the other one is blocked.
      This means that when left is block for a long time, and then both are free, the right will get mostly 5 items
      before it is split 1:1 again.
    - Fixed that the electric pole has the same orientation all the time (regardless connections)
  Gui:
    - Removed the text length limit from the input console.
    - Wrapping of the console text in the game.
  Modding:
    - Mods are self sustainable folders now. They contain the prototype definitions, graphics, sounds, locale, scenarios or campaigns.
    - Mods Gui in the game to enable / disable mods and change their ordering.
    - The default game contents is treated as a mod (called base).
    - Prototype definitions are generated by Lua scripts (no json anymore). Mods can manipulate the definitions from previous mods.
    - Mods can have control.lua script that supplements / changes the behavior of the default scenario script.
    - Multiple running scripts (from the mods) can communicate with each other using interfaces.
    - General furnace energy source specification in json (so it can be electric)
    - Started to use the name of the recipe, this allows different recipes for the same product.
      Having different recipes for the same product for player crafting is not tested (regarding the auto crafting)
    - Translation files are merged properly.
    - Default English fallback for translations.
  Scripting:
    - Simple way to add GUI elements using script.
    - Divided the player and its character, some functions that are not directly connected with the character (goal description, printing etc)
      are accessible from the player object, the rest from the character.
      The access to character is game.player.character
    - The migration script runs before the control.lua is loaded and can be used to reload scripts from the original scenario
      this is used to solve the issue of incompatible scripts in the save game.
    - Merged onunitdied and onplayerdied to on_entity_died
    - Check for positive addition in the LuaInventory::insert method
    - Added LuaInventory::remove method
    - Added LuaInventory::get_contents method
    - Simpler access to player from game object (game.player instead of game.get_player())
    - Added LuaRecipe::reload method
    - Added force parameter in create_entity so player can specify the owner of the created entity (was always enemy now)
    - Added way to change force of entity and damage entity (damaging is different then sethealth).
    - Position doesn't need to be in format {x = 34, y = 7}, the format {34 ,7} works as well, the
      same with bounding box.
    - Added simple interface for the Freeplay that allows manipulating the attacks from mod scripts.
    - Scripts receive only events they have subscribed to.
    - Scripts can emit their own events (for instance Freeplay emits an event whenever it starts the attack).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      a) Lua-based migrations work for these saves.
      b) It is possible to run console commands in these games.
    - Tool tip in technology preview shows total raw in the same system as in player crafting GUI
      (Using just recipes that player can use for the calculations, so not smelting)

    - Added Lua force object
    - Added function get_entity_count into the force object, used this to fix minor bug in level-02
      where count of mining drills/furnaces was done manually
    - In Lua set_multi_command now returns number of units sent
    - Moved functions getrecipes and gettechnologies from the LuaEntity to LuaForce.
  Modding:
    - Recipe categories (Both crafting and furnace recipes merged into one list, recipes are categorised now)
    - Current recipe categories are "crafting" + "smelting", it is now possible to add new recipe
      categories in the prototype-definitions/recipe-category folder.
    - Player/Assembling machine/Furnace prototype contains list of recipe categories they can use, this
      should make it easier to make specialised machines.
