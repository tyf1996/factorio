[gui-graphics-settings-description]
minimize-on-focus-loss=When running in borderless full screen, the game will minimize itself on focus loss to make sure it doesn't cover your desktop when you want to switch to a different application.
max-threads=The number of threads used to render the game.
graphics-quality-label=The resolution of the sprites. Determines VRAM usage. Warning: "High" resolution requires at least 3 GB of VRAM.
show-animated-water=Disable to increase performance on low-end video cards.
show-tree-distortion=Disable to increase performance on low-end video cards.
lights-quality=The rendering resolution of lights during the night. High values will greatly reduce performance.
show-smoke=When disabled, the number of smoke effects that are rendered will be greatly reduced. Disable to increase performance on low-end video cards.
video-memory-usage-label=Determines how many sprites the game will try to put into sprite atlases. Creating larger sprite atlases reduces CPU usage due to the ability to batch draw calls, but may increase GPU load because the GPU has to work with larger textures. Free-floating sprites can be loaded into VRAM or kept in RAM (see Texture streaming setting).
video-memory-budget-label=The maximum size of video memory (VRAM) the game is allowed to use for textures (sprites).
texture-streaming=Sprites that were not put into any sprite atlas (see Video memory usage setting) will be kept in RAM until needed by the GPU.
texture-compression=Texture compression greatly increases number of sprites the game can fit to the video memory, and speeds up rendering due to GPU having to transfer less data during shading. If you have an old or integrated GPU, select low quality to reduce the size of sprites even more to get extra performance.
sprite-atlas-size-label=Larger atlases improve draw call batching, which reduces CPU load in rendering, but may be harder to handle for the GPU.
high-quality-animations=If disabled, some animated or rotated entities (for example, trains) will load only half of the normal count of animation or rotation frames. This greatly reduces VRAM usage.
full-color-depth=Rendering in only half (16-bit) color depth improves performance on low-end and integrated GPUs. This option only has an effect on Windows 8+ or in the OpenGL renderer.
render-in-native-resolution=On high-DPI screens (for example, Apple Retina), rendering in the native resolution will produce a higher quality image but may be very demanding on performance.
use-flip-presentation-model=Flip presentation should be the more efficient method of presenting the final image on a screen than the older Blit model. Try toggling this option if you experience graphical glitches or framerate issues.
show-game-simulations-in-background=When in the main menu and sub menus, shows various game simulations in place of the background.
